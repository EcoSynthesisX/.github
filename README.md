# EcoSynthesisX: Impact in Real Life through Web3 for a Better Future

At EcoSynthesisX, we're using the latest Web3 and blockchain technology to make a real difference. We have exciting projects like ImpactNFT Collections and our ImpactNFT Marketplace, which highlights the positive contributions people are making through our Impact Onchain Rank. We're improving the way IRL public goods are funded.
