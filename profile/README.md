----------------------------------------
## Problems: 

* Not enough funding for in real life NGOs and Communities

* Leak of motivation for potential investors

* No infrastructure for selling IRL NGOs and Communities products

## Vision:

Our vision is to tokenize the positive impact generated by nonprofits, creating on-chain Impact Products that can be sold or distributed through blockchain infrastructure and our Impact Marketplace

This model channels on-chain/Off-chain capital directly into the hands of nonprofits, expanding their funding sources and amplifying their ability to make a difference
