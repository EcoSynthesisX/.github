----------------------------------------

## Problems: 

* Not enough funding for in real life NGOs and Communities
* Leak of motivation for potential investors
* No infrastructure for selling IRL NGOs and Communities products

## Vision:

Our vision includes tokenization of positive impact produced by non for profits in form of onchain impact products that can be sold/distributed via blockchain infrastructure and our Impact Marketplace. This will allow to attract more onchain capital into non for profits hands. Thereby empower their activities.

## Mission:

Our mission is to empower in real life impact creators such are non for profit NGOs and communities working in different public good spheres
