# EcoSynthesisX: Impact in Real Life through Web3 for a Better Future

At EcoSynthesisX, we're using the latest Web3 and blockchain technology to make a real difference. We have exciting projects like Impact Products Collections and our Impact Marketplace, which highlights the positive contributions people are making through our IRL Impact Rank. We're improving the way IRL public goods are funded.
